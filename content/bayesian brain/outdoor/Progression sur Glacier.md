- Gear adapted for alpinism
- Know how to rope yourself
- Know how to orient yourself in fog
- know the basic of rescue
- Must be roped

- Limit the number of sharp turns
- Adapt speed to the person on the steepest part of the hill

The more the merrier: more people is safer in case of a fall.

## Terrain rocheux/mix

- Rocky terrain, easy = short rope (aka corde courte)
- Roche, arrete = corde tendue with slings, and cam and nut (Coinceur in French)
- Rocky terrain, hard = tire des longeurs

## Rope techniques

* Short rope is very dangerous.
* Corde tendue = use the env for anchors

In alpinism we ==always use "corde a simple"== (these can be doubled if it is long enough). <!--SR:!2025-01-03,121,270-->

The challenge of a run is finding ==the optimal way to move forward based on the different technics==. <!--SR:!2024-12-29,127,290-->
