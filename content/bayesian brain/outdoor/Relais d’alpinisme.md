# Relais d’alpinisme

As seen in [[Progression sur Glacier#Rope techniques]] walking corde tendue we use the environment (I.e rocks) has a security when progressing.

If it is safe it is unnecessary to vacher yourself. However if needed, most of the time it is enough to ==turn the rope around a rock two times==; friction will do the rest. 

To make a [[Relais]], take a long sling and make a [[Noeud coulant]] on it. Pass the knot around the rock and tighten it.

Add a carabiner to the sling, put a [[Demi-cabestan]] on it and you can now belay people under.

Otherwise, one can do a [[Relais#Relais sans équipement]].
