### Multi-Pitch Climbing

4 pillars to safety:

* climbing skills/technic
* Topo
* [[Rope]]
* Communication (including when you don’t see each others)

## Communication

Say names.
Thumbs up is I’m on direct. Can also be three **bug** tugs 
Second thumbs up is you are safe you can start climbing.
Could also be two **big** tugs

## Going up

Faire attention à l’[[Assurage]] en fonction de qui est premier ou second de cordé.
Voir [[Assurage#Assurance du grimpeur en tête]] et [[Assurage#Assurage du second de cordé]].

## Coming down

You need a twin rope to be able to go down.
A single rope can be used if:

1. Another group has a twin rope and goes down after you so they can pick up your rope
2. You have enough of the half rope to go to the next station
3. You can walk down from the top and not [[Rappel]].

Pour descendre suivre [[Rappel#Switch station on the way down]].
