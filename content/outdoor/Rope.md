# Rope

Itâ€™s important to check your rope is ok.
Go through and feel if there is something bad
Important to wash the rope especially when in sand or dirt.
Washing is good because the rope damages the equipment more otherwise.
Damage on the outer layer is ok but need to be careful of sharp edge on the way.

## Twin rope

This means this rope can be used as a twin rope or a half rope.

Double rope are safer in case of problem but are heavier.

When climbing with a double rope you can either put both rope in the QuickDraw or you can put them in one after the other.
