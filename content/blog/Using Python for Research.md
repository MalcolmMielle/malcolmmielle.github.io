In this article, I will explain what I think are important development steps for research using Python.
Your goal as a researcher should always be:

1. Reproduction of the results.
2. Clarity of the method.
3. Friendliness to collaboration and extension of your work by the scientific community.

In general, I see a lot of research code being published without [[CI for Python Research|CI/CD]], [[Python style guide|code guideline]], correct [[Python packaging for researchers#Packaging|packaging]] strategies, or docker images, making collaboration and reproduction harder.
However, such tooling (especially in Python) is readily available and easy to set up.

Here are articles, that are part of this series (which might be extended in the future):

1. [[Python packaging for researchers]]
2. [[CI for Python Research]]
